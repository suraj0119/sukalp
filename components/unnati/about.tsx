              <strong>Overview:</strong> UNNATI, meaning "Progress" in Hindi, is an education-forward initiative led by
              Sukalp Foundation aimed at nurturing academic excellence and boosting opportunities for underprivileged
              and motivated students. This initiative focuses on equipping school-going children from diverse
              backgrounds with the knowledge, mentorship, and resources required to excel in various scholarship
              examinations and competitive entrance tests.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              By doing so, UNNATI strives not only to strengthen the academic foundation of students but also to instill
              a sense of purpose, achievement, and financial independence through scholarships. The long-term goal is to
              improve student retention in educational institutions and reduce drop-out rates due to financial hardship.
